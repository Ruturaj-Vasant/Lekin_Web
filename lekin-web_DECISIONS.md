# Decisions Log — lekin-web

Append-only log of changes made to `lekin-web`, in order, with reasoning.
Read this whole file at the start of every new session before doing any work.
Never delete or rewrite past entries — if a decision is later reversed, add a
new entry saying so and why, rather than editing the old one.

Each entry should follow this format:

```
## [YYYY-MM-DD] <short title>
- Branch: <branch name>
- Phase: <Phase 1 / 2 / 3 / 4, per the master prompt roadmap>
- What changed:
- Why:
- Alternatives considered / tradeoffs:
- Tests added:
- Status: (in review / merged / reverted)
```

---

## [YYYY-MM-DD] Repo created (placeholder)
- Branch: n/a
- Phase: n/a
- What changed: Created empty `lekin-web` repo as a placeholder. No
  implementation started — waiting on `lekin-library` Phase 0 to complete
  first, since the web app is built against its finished interface.
- Why: Keep the two repos separate from day one so `lekin-library` stays a
  clean, standalone package and `lekin-web` only ever depends on a pinned
  version of it via the shared JSON schema.
- Alternatives considered / tradeoffs: n/a
- Tests added: none yet
- Status: merged
